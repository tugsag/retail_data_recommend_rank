# Recommendation and tanking on retailrocket dataset (from Kaggle)

Uses sklearn for prediction (from viewcount, can we predict whether a customer will buy a product?).
Uses surprise library for matrix factorization (Unable to complete due to memory limitations, but core code is present. Will complete in future).
Uses LightGBM library to rank.
Uses recommenders library to play around with a few DL collaborative filtering approaches. Again unable to complete due to memory and versioning issues.
Mainly used as practice.
